## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a simple command-line interface (CLI) application that fetches and displays current weather information for a specified location. It leverages a third-party API to retrieve real-time weather data and presents it in an easy-to-read format.

## Features

  * **Current Weather Data:** Retrieves temperature, humidity, and weather conditions (e.g., "clear sky", "cloudy") for any given city or ZIP code.
  * **Error Handling:** Provides informative messages for common issues such as:
      * City not found.
      * Invalid API key.
      * Network connectivity problems.
      * Problems parsing the API response.
  * **User-Friendly Output:** Displays weather details clearly on the console.

## Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine:

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  * **`requests` library:** This library is used for making HTTP requests to the weather API. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
  * **OpenWeatherMap API Key:**
      * Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account.
      * Once registered and logged in, navigate to the "API keys" section of your dashboard.
      * Copy your generated API key. It might take a few minutes for a newly generated key to become active.

### 2\. Code Setup

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the provided Python code into a file named `weather_app.py` (or any other `.py` extension).

2.  **Insert Your API Key:** Open `weather_app.py` in a text editor and find the following line within the `main()` function:

    ```python
    API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

    **Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key that you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.** For example:

    ```python
    API_KEY = "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890" # Use your real key here!
    ```

    **Important:** Do not share your API key publicly.

### 3\. Running the Application

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.

2.  Navigate to the directory where you saved `weather_app.py`.

3.  Run the application using the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python weather_app.py
    ```

4.  The application will prompt you to "Enter a city name or ZIP code:". Type your desired location and press Enter.

    ```
    Enter a city name or ZIP code: London
    ```

### Example Output:

```
--- ☀️ Current Weather ---
Location: London, GB
Temperature: 15.23°C
Humidity: 87%
Conditions: Light Rain
-------------------------
```

## Tools Used

  * **Python 3.x:** The programming language used for developing the application logic.
  * **`requests` Library:** A popular Python library for making HTTP requests to web services.
  * **OpenWeatherMap API:** A third-party web service that provides current and forecasted weather data.
  * **JSON:** The data format used for communication between the application and the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Outcome

This project successfully delivers a functional command-line weather application capable of:

  * Interacting with a public API to retrieve specific data.
  * Handling potential errors during API calls (e.g., network issues, invalid input, API key problems).
  * Parsing JSON responses to extract and present relevant information to the user in a clear and organized manner.

It demonstrates fundamental concepts of API integration, error handling, and basic CLI user interaction in Python.

# Python Weather App

A simple and advanced weather application built with Python. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A basic version for getting weather data directly in the terminal.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: An advanced version with a user-friendly interface built using Tkinter.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches current temperature, humidity, conditions, and wind speed.
- **Unit Conversion**: The GUI version allows switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Weather Icons**: The GUI version displays an icon representing the current weather conditions.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git (for cloning)

### 1. Get an API Key

This project requires a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

1.  Sign up for a free account.
2.  Go to the 'API keys' tab and copy your key.
3.  Paste the key into both `weather_cli.py` and `weather_gui.py` where it says `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/weather-app.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/weather-app.git)
cd weather-app
